    "This dataset contains information about student study habits, exam performance, and overall knowledge level on the subject of electrical DC machines. The dataset was provided by undergraduate studnets at the Department of Electrical Education of Gazi University. Information on overall knowledge level was collected using an intuitive knowledge classifier \n",

    "What is a person's overall knowledge level of electrical Dierect Current (DC) machines based on their duration of study of relavent materials and exam performance?\n",

    "The User Knowledge Modeling Data Set was used for this project. This project will develop a method for classifying observations with unknown UNS values. UNS is a type of factor variable which classifies level of student understanding of electrical DC machines. Classification predictions will be made based on the STG and PEG columns, which are double floating point variables that contain observations for degree of study time for relevant materials and exam performance for relevant goals respectively.
